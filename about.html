            <h2>It Started with a Simple Desire</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Our story began in our own kitchen, preparing meals for our daughter. We wanted to serve her food we could trust – wholesome, flavorful, and bursting with real ingredients. That simple desire grew into something bigger: a mission to bring that same care and quality to every table we serve.</p>
                
                <p>Fork in the Road VA was born from the belief that exceptional food starts with exceptional ingredients. Virginia's rich agricultural heritage provides everything we need to create memorable meals, yet we noticed a gap – no one was bringing these farm-fresh flavors directly to corporate events, weddings, and community gatherings through mobile catering.</p>
                
                <p>So we took the fork in the road less traveled. We built relationships with local farmers, learned their stories, and made a commitment: 95% of our ingredients would come from Virginia farms within 50 miles of our kitchen. It's not always the easiest path, but it's the right one.</p>
                
                <p>Today, Fork in the Road VA bridges the gap between Virginia's thriving farms and your celebrations. Every dish we serve honors the land it came from and the people who grew it. We're not just caterers – we're storytellers, using food to connect our community to its agricultural roots.</p>

    <!-- Why Farm-to-Table -->

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why Farm-to-Table Matters</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                In an era of global supply chains and year-round everything, we've chosen a different path. Farm-to-table isn't just a marketing term for us – it's a fundamental philosophy that shapes every decision we make.
            </p>
            
            <div class="philosophy-points">
                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Flavor at Its Peak</h3>
                    <p>Ingredients harvested at the perfect moment and delivered within days simply taste better. There's no substitute for a tomato ripened on the vine or greens picked that morning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Supporting Local Economy</h3>
                    <p>Every dollar spent with Fork in the Road circulates through our local economy. We're not just feeding people; we're sustaining family farms and rural livelihoods.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>Sourcing within 50 miles dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Seasonal menus mean we're working with nature, not against it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Transparency & Trust</h3>
                    <p>We can tell you exactly where your food comes from because we know the farmers personally. That level of transparency builds trust and connection.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Preserving Food Heritage</h3>
                    <p>Working with local farms helps preserve heirloom varieties and traditional growing methods that would otherwise disappear in industrial agriculture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <h3>Building Community</h3>
                    <p>Farm-to-table creates meaningful connections between diners, chefs, and farmers. Your event becomes part of a larger story about community and shared values.</p>
